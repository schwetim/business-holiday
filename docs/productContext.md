## 🎯 Why This Project Exists
Business travelers often want to combine their work trips with leisure. There’s currently no streamlined service that:
- Finds business events in attractive, holiday-ready destinations
- Matches these with hotels and flights
- Lets users book everything easily via trusted external providers

This project closes that gap — without acting as a tour operator.

## 🧩 What Problems It Solves
- No central way to discover professional events in desirable destinations
- Travel planning is fragmented: flights, hotels, events are in separate places
- Businesses struggle to justify “biz-leisure” trips without structured documentation

## �️ How It Should Work
1. **User inputs** industry, departure airport, and date range
2. Platform shows **matching events** with combined price estimates (event + hotel + flight)
3. User selects a trip package (event + hotel + flight)
4. They are redirected to trusted affiliates (Booking.com, WayAway.io) for final bookings
5. Event ticket links are also provided

The product doesn’t process payments or bookings — it curates, matches, and redirects.

**You make money via affiliate commissions**, not bookings.
