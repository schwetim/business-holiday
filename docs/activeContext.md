## âœ… Current Focus: MVP Implementation

We're building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with:

- Event selection interface
- Hotel and flight suggestions
- Affiliate redirection
- No user accounts or booking logic

## ðŸ§­ Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Core App Setup

âœ… Frontend container running with Next.js
âœ… Backend container running with Express
âœ… Database container ready
âœ… Set up initial API endpoints (/api/events)
âœ… Configure frontend environment (NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL) with proper Docker networking setup
âœ… Set up frontend routing structure:
  - Home page with search form and HeroBanner
  - Events listing page with API integration
  - Test environment page
âœ… Implement core UI components:
  - HeroBanner with responsive design
  - IndustrySelect with API integration
  - SelectField reusable component
âœ… Implement environment-aware API service:
  - Development: Next.js API routes for proxying
  - Production: Direct API calls to backend
  - Unified error handling
  - Prevention of duplicate calls

### 2. Data Layer

âœ… Set up Prisma schema
âœ… Configure database migrations
âœ… Implement data models for:
  - Events (with full address and import fields)
  - Click tracking
  - Bookings (reference only)
âœ… Implement CSV import functionality:
  - Auto-import test data in development
  - Support for external IDs and image paths
  - Duplicate prevention via externalId

### 3. Feature Development

Current Focus:
- Implement search interface
  âœ… Industry selection with API integration
  - Region/location selection
  - Date range picker
- Add event listing page
- Integrate hotel suggestions
- Add flight search functionality
- Implement affiliate redirects

### 4. Testing + Launch

- Write integration tests
- Perform load testing
- Set up monitoring
âœ… Configure production deployment (Dockerfile with multi-stage build)
âœ… Set up environment-specific configurations:
  - Development: Docker-based with API proxying
  - Production: Vercel/Render with direct API calls
- Launch MVP version

## ðŸ§± Scope Guardrails

- No login/account system
- No actual booking/payment logic
- No mobile optimization (for MVP)
