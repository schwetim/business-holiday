## üèó Project Structure

### Frontend (`/frontend`)
- Next.js application with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Pages structure for routing:
  - Home page (search form)
  - Events page (dynamic listing)
  - Test environment page
  - API routes:
    - Health check endpoint with rate limiting
    - Request proxy with retry logic
- API Service:
  - Centralized request handling
  - Health check integration
  - Retry mechanism with backoff
  - Error handling and logging
- Components:
  - IndustrySelect with retry logic
  - Loading states with attempt tracking
  - Manual retry capabilities
  - Error state handling
- Environment configuration via .env.frontend
- Docker containerized with volume mounts

### Backend (`/backend`)
- Express.js server with TypeScript
- RESTful API design:
  - /api/events endpoint
  - /api/health endpoint for status monitoring
  - Quick response times (3s timeout)
  - Connection status reporting
- Docker containerized (dev and prod):
  - Health monitoring
  - Startup coordination
  - Connection resilience
  - Service readiness checks
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- Auto-import script for development data
- CSV-based event import with image mapping

### Database
- PostgreSQL container
- Prisma schema with models:
  - Event (business events):
    - Full address fields (country, city, etc.)
    - Import support (externalId, imagePath)
    - Geolocation data (latitude, longitude)
  - ClickLog (affiliate tracking)
  - Booking (reference logging)
